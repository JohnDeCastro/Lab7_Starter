1. "Within a Github axction that runs whenever code is pushed" - ouf of the 3 options, this one seems to align with the goal of automating tests. Doing so after every push would help ensure code is validated or otherwised addressed then and there. 
2. No. 
3. Navigation mode primarily analyzes after loading but does not analyze interactions / changes in content. Snapshot mode analyzes page as-is "snapshot", prioritizing accessiblity checking. 
4. Add 'A <meta name="viewport"> ' tag, add meta desciption, and use legible font sizes. (I used PageSpeed Insights rather than Chrome).
